These tests simulate daily user habits (charging and discharging once a day) and indicate that 1600 cycles equal approximately 4 years of usage. The above data was provided by iQOO's lab according to tests conducted in a simulated environment, with ambient and battery temperatures of 23°C±2°C for a full charge and discharge. Actual results may vary due to differences in test equipment, the test environment, as well as personal usage patterns and habits.",

The resistance to splashes, water and dust is not permanent and may be reduced due to daily use. Do not charge the mobile phone when it is wet. Refer to Safety information in Settings for cleaning and drying instructions. Damage due to liquid ingress is not covered by the warranty. These tests were conducted in controlled conditions in iQOO lab. Please follow the instructions for using the phone.",

Due to differences in network environments, individual usage habits, and other factors, the actual experience may vary.",
